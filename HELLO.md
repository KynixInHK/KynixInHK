<h1 style="color: red">HELLO.</h1>

<h1 style="color: orange">This is Kynix Chan.</h1>

<h2 style="color: yellow">I come from Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°. Also lived in Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼. Now I'm a student in Baotuquan Campus, Shandong University in Jinan, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³.</h2>

<h3 style="color: green">If you are a Chinese speaker, it's my honour to introduce my Chinese name, é™ˆè¯º or é™³è«¾ in traditional Chinese to you. Feel free to call my Chinese name! I'm glad to hear that!</h3>

<h4 style = "color: blue">If you are familiar with Shandong University, you would know that the Baotuquan campus is a campus full of medical students. So definitely I am one of them, too.</h4>

<h5 style="color: indigo">I also have a lot of habits. Such as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">MUSIC</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">SOCCOR</span>. </h5>

<h6 style="color: purple">OK. Actually I am a learner of Vue.js, node.js and Java. Now I am a developer of JavaScript.</h6>
